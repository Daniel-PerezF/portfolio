              Hello there! I'm Daniel, a software developer with a passion for
              technology that traces back to my childhood. Growing up surrounded
              by a household computer and educational games, I was always
              curious about the magic happening behind the scenes.
              <br />
              <br />
              As I explored various career paths, it wasn't until the rise of AI
              captured my attention that I decided to dive deep into the world
              of software, AI, and coding. Further realizing that code is the
              backbone of everything tech-related, I embarked on a self-learning
              journey and later enrolled in the LearningFuze coding bootcamp in
              Irvine, California.
              <br />
              <br />
              The intensive full-stack software development course not only
              expanded my technological skills but also provided a profound
              self-discovery experience. It was during this time that I
              uncovered my genuine passion for coding and software development.
              Coming from a background of creative and artistic interests, I
              found immense satisfaction in web design, allowing me to express
              myself in a whole new way.
              <br />
              <br />
              Completing the bootcamp was a turning point, revealing my true
              calling in a field that excites me. Now, I'm thrilled to continue
              growing and learning in the ever-evolving world of software
              development. Join me on this journey, and let's see where the
              future takes us! Let's create something amazing! ðŸš€
